# Maze
A 8×8 maze is used as the environment. The maze is represented as a two-dimensional grid, where each cell can either be free or blocked. The agent starts from a predefined initial position and aims to reach the goal state at position (7, 7). Different search algorithms are applied to explore the maze and find a valid path to the goal.
